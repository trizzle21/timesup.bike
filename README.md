# Time's Up Bike Website (timesup.bike)

Pedal-powered mutual aid > car-centric capitalism. This repo holds the Astro site that spreads the word.

## Run the project

1. Node.js 18+ and npm ready? You're halfway there.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Fire up the dev server with `npm run dev` and hit `http://localhost:4321`

Additional scripts for the collective:

| Command           | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run build`   | Compile the production build into `dist/`  |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally       |

4. If using Decap CMS, run `npx decap-server` and go to `http://localhost:4321/admin/index.html`.  If it is asking for a username and password, the decap-server is probably not running

## Contributing

No gatekeepers here. Open a PR and let's ship.

1. Fork, branch, and hack on the change you want to see.
2. Run the project locally so the revolution actually loads.
3. Open a PR against `main`, explain the strategy, and note any follow-ups.

Screens, repro steps, and focused diffs help everyone move faster.
