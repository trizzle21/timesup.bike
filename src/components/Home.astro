			<h2>How to Join</h2>
			<p>
			Time’s Up! is an all-volunteer environmental education and direct action non-profit group. Our Bike Co-op’s goal is to give everyone 
			enough knowledge to maintain their bikes, and hopefully, teach others to do the same.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				There are many ways that you can volunteer and help Time’s Up!’s Bike Co-op. First and foremost, Time’s Up! 
				relies on a strong membership base, so if you have not joined already, please do so at our Membership Page. If you are 
				interested in becoming a mechanic, or in helping out with bicycle repair at the weekly workshops, e-mail <a href="mailto:contact@timesup.bike">contact@timesup.bike</a> 
				or drop by the Manhattan space (626 E 14th St.) on Wednesday or Sunday afternoons. We’ll pair you with a current mechanic 
				so you can learn the ropes of the space and gain hands-on maintenance skills. If you cannot schedule a specific time 
				for a committed volunteership, you can volunteer on an impromptu basis.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				If you are interested in helping out at one of Time’s Up!’s group rides or other outdoor activities, e-mail 
				<a href="mailto:timesup.events@gmail.com">timesup.events@gmail.com</a>. Otherwise, the best thing you can do to help out 
				is show up to the workshops and events regularly. There’s always ample opportunity to contribute and make a difference!
